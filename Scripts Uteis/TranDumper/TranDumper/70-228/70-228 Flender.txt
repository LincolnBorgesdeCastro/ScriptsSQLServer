      1. You are the administrator of two Mircosoft Windows 2000 computers. One 
      computer is running Internet Information Services (IIS), and the other is 
      running SQL Server 2000. Company partners need to connect by means of the 
      Internet and query data stored on the SQL Server computer. Some of these 
      partners have computers that do not use Microsoft operating systems or Web 
      browsers.

      You need to configure the IIS and SQL Server 2000 computers to allow 
      access to data by means of the IIS virtual directory. IIS uses Basic 
      Authentication to allow access to the virtual directory.

      Only company partners should have access to the SQL Server computer by 
      means of the Internet. The partners should NOT be allowed to make ad hoc 
      queries. You want to be able to audit successful and failed logins to the 
      SQL Server computer.

      You want to allow the partners access to the SQL Server computer while 
      keeping your security scheme as simple as possible. Which two actions 
      should you take? (Each correct answer represents part of the solution. 
      Choose two.)

      a. Configure the IIS virtual directory to allow URL queries.

      b. Configure the IIS virtual directory to allow template queries.

      c. Create a new Windows user account.
      Create a corresponding Windows Authenticated login on the SQL Server 
      computer. Configure the IIS virtual directory to always use this login 
      when connecting to the SQL Server computer.

      d. Create a Windows Authenticated login on the SQL Server computer for the 
      IIS Internet Guest Account.
      Configure the IIS virtual directory to always use the Internet Guest 
      Account when connecting to the SQL Server computer.

      e. Create a Windows Authenticated login for each company partner on the 
      SQL Server computer.
      Configure the IIS virtual directory to use Windows Integrated 
      Authentication when connecting to the SQL Server computer.

ANSWER: B, C


      2.You are a database administrator in the Los Angeles branch office of a 
      speciality foods supplier. A mainframe database at the headquaters 
      contains all company data. Each branch office contains a SQL Server 2000 
      computer that imports regional data from the mainframe database.

      The server in Los Angeles contains a Data Transformation Services (DTS)
      package that uses OLE DB to connect to the company's mainframe database.
      The DTS package extracts and transforms data about buyers and products
      for that region. The DTS package then writes the data to the SQL Server
      database in Los Angeles.

      You need to configure a SQL Server computer for the new branch office in 
      Sydney. You want to copy the Los Angeles package and modify it so that it 
      writes data to the SQL Server database in Sydney.

      You use the DTS Designer to modify the DTS package so that it imports 
      regional data from the mainframe database to the server in Sydney. The 
      modified DTS package runs successfully on the server in Los Angeles. You 
      save this DTS package to the server in Sydney, but the server in Sydney 
      cannot connect to the mainframe database.

      You want to enable the server in Sydney to connect to the mainframe 
      database. What should you do?

      a. Change the connection properties in the DTS package so that the package 
      uses new login credentials to connect to the mainframe database.

      b. Modify the workflow in the DTS package so that the server in Syndey is 
      included.

      c. On the server in Sydney, install an OLE DB provider for the mainframe 
      database.

      d. On the server in Sydney, delete and then re-create the DTS package.

ANSWER: C
